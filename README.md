WinSPCheck
==========

some little tool I wrote to get a quick information about installed service packs on windows. since Windows 7 SP1 was the last one of these service packs, I decided to extend the functionality to display installed .Net frameworks.

! https://github.com/evilbaschdi/EvilBaschdi.Core is required for this project !
The recommended way is to store / clone both repositories in the same root directory.
Next step would be to open and restore the nuget packages of EvilBaschdi.Core project.

Now you can open and rebuild the WinSPCheck project. The EvilBaschdi.Core project will be rebuild automatically as a pre-build step of WinSPCheck.
